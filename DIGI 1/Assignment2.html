    Let's have some coding language and its details

                python
            </summary>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.</p>

                C language
            </summary>
            <p>C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language initially developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is widely known for its efficiency, portability, and versatility, making it one of the most influential and enduring programming languages in the history of computing.</p>

                C++ language
            </summary>
            <p>C++ is a powerful, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is an extension of the C programming language. It was developed in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an enhancement to C to support object-oriented programming (OOP) and provide additional features and capabilities. C++ retains the efficiency and low-level access of C while adding modern programming paradigms, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</p>

                Java programming
            </summary>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle) in the mid-1990s. It was designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. Java is widely used for a variety of applications, including web development, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and more.</p>

                HTML
            </summary>
            <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It forms the backbone of most web pages and is used to define the layout, structure, and presentation of the content within a web document. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to mark up elements, which are then rendered by web browsers to display the content to users.</p>
